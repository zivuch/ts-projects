# TypeScript and React Exercises: To-Do List and Data Fetching

In this set of exercises, you will build a **To-Do List Application** and create a **Generic Data Fetching Component**, applying **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Redux Toolkit**. These exercises will guide you through key concepts such as state management, component design, generics, and handling asynchronous data fetching. By completing all the exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in developing scalable, maintainable, and type-safe applications.

### General Learning Objectives:

- Gain a deep understanding of **TypeScript basics** and advanced features like **generics**.
- Learn to structure **React applications** with reusable and maintainable components.
- Master **Redux Toolkit** for managing complex global state efficiently.
- Handle **asynchronous data fetching** and implement robust **error handling** for real-world applications.

## 1. To-Do List Application with TypeScript and Data Sources

### What You Will Learn:

- **TypeScript Fundamentals**: Explore TypeScript’s type system, including classes, interfaces, and annotations.
- **Data Management**: Implement CRUD operations using TypeScript classes and store data using **localStorage**.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Update the DOM dynamically based on the state of the application.
- **Event Handling**: Set up event listeners to manage user interactions such as adding and removing tasks.
- **Modular Project Structure**: Learn to organize a project with **Vite**, ensuring a scalable and maintainable setup.

### Description:

In this exercise, you will build a simple **To-Do List Application** using **TypeScript**. You’ll create and manage tasks, store them in **localStorage**, and dynamically update the DOM based on user actions. By applying TypeScript’s features like classes and interfaces, you’ll ensure the application is type-safe and maintainable. The exercise will also introduce you to organizing projects with **Vite**.

## 2. Building a To-Do List Application with React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit

### What You Will Learn:

- **State Management**: Leverage **Redux Toolkit** to handle the application’s global state and manage tasks effectively.
- **Component Architecture**: Design and build modular, reusable React components.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strengthen your React app with TypeScript, ensuring a robust type-safe environment.
- **Custom Hooks**: Develop reusable hooks to interact with the Redux store and encapsulate complex logic.

### Description:

In this exercise, you’ll extend the **To-Do List Application** by integrating **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux Toolkit**. You’ll manage the application’s state using Redux and Redux Toolkit to create actions and reducers, driving the UI updates. You’ll also focus on designing a flexible and reusable component architecture, and you’ll use **custom hooks** to simplify interactions with the Redux store. This exercise will provide you with a strong foundation in building scalable React-Redux applications.

## 3. Daily Challenge: Creating a Generic Data Fetching Component with React, TypeScript, and Redux

### What You Will Learn:

- **TypeScript Generics**: Use TypeScript generics to create reusable and type-safe components that handle different data types.
- **React Hooks**: Manage component state and side effects using **useState**, **useEffect**, and custom hooks.
- **Redux Integration**: Manage global state with Redux, implementing actions and reducers to handle data fetching and storing results.
- **Data Fetching**: Fetch data from an API with proper error handling and display it dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: Implement strategies to handle API errors and manage loading states effectively.

### Description:

In this daily challenge, you’ll create a **generic data fetching component** using **React, TypeScript, and Redux**. This component will be designed to fetch data from different APIs and display it, all while maintaining type safety with TypeScript generics. You’ll use **Redux** to manage global state and handle the asynchronous nature of data fetching, ensuring the application remains responsive. The exercise will push your understanding of TypeScript generics, asynchronous operations, and error handling.
